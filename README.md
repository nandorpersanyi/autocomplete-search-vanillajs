Autocomplete search Github users with vanilla JS for Ginetta.

I have used the [webpack-starter-basic](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic) starter kit for this project.

The API key in the repo is a zero permission Github API key, only present in the repo for the sake of simplicity, and will be regenerated in a couple of days and rendered useless.

## Usage

Clone the repository

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/nandorpersanyi/autocomplete-search-vanillajs.git
 cd autocomplete-search-vanillajs
```

Install npm dependencies

```sh
 npm install 
```

Start the development server

```sh
npm start
```

Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```

Preview the production build
```sh
npm run preview
```
